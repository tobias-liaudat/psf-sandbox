# Detailed Analysis

This section contains a more detailed analysis on 3 specific tests:

- __test-14:__ Consists of the classic RCA method using the graph constraint to generate the VT matrix.

- __test-15:__ Consists of the RCA method using the polynomial VT matrix (PSFEx style)

- __test-18:__ Consists of the hybrid RCA method that uses a VT matrix made of the graph constraint and the polynomial PSFEx-style matrices.
